Hi, 

for the Slotcar lap counter I got the
UHF-PLL-Modulator bundle for www.pollin.de.
(https://www.pollin.de/p/uhf-pll-modulator-bausatz-bundle-810263)

It cost 10 bugs and has power supply and LCD already include.

Connect ACD1 (sensor for the 1. car) to the "TESTBILD" button. Without R9 and C6!
Connect ACD2 (sensor for the 2. car) to the "KANAL_RUNTER" button. Without R10 and C7!
Solder button "Kanal_RAUF" as described. (You use to switch between current lap time and best time.)
You don't have to solder modulator or jack 2 + 3.

LED1 indicates if the display shows the best lap or the current laptime and the number of laps.
